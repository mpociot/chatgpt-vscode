Use Case: Cafeteria Management System for Employees

Title: Order and Payment for Employee Meals

Actors:

Employee: The person who works in the organization and wants to order meals from the cafeteria.
Cafeteria Staff: The staff responsible for managing the cafeteria operations.
Description:
The Cafeteria Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the ordering and payment process for employee meals in the organization's cafeteria. The system aims to streamline the cafeteria operations, provide a convenient way for employees to order meals, and ensure efficient payment handling.

Main Flow:

Employee Login:

The employee accesses the Cafeteria Management System through a secure login page using their unique credentials.
View Menu:

After logging in, the employee is presented with the cafeteria menu for the current day, displaying available meal options, prices, and any special promotions or discounts.
Select Meal:

The employee selects their desired meal from the menu by choosing the appropriate options, such as main course, side dish, and beverage.
Customize Order:

If there are customization options available for the selected meal (e.g., choosing toppings or dietary preferences), the employee can make the necessary selections.
Add to Cart:

Once the meal order is customized, the employee adds it to their cart for review and further actions.
Review Cart:

The employee reviews the items in their cart, including the selected meals, quantities, and total amount payable.
Place Order:

The employee confirms the order and proceeds to place it, indicating their intention to proceed with the payment.
Payment Options:

The system presents various payment options to the employee, such as credit card, employee meal card, or direct deduction from their salary.
Make Payment:

The employee selects the preferred payment method and provides the necessary details or authentication.
Payment Confirmation:

Once the payment is successfully processed, the system generates a payment confirmation message, and the employee receives an email or SMS notification.
Order Fulfillment:

The cafeteria staff receives the order details on their system and prepares the meal accordingly, ensuring timely delivery or pickup options.
Collect Meal:

The employee visits the cafeteria at the designated time to collect their prepared meal, presenting their employee identification for verification.
Alternative Flow:

In case of any issues or discrepancies with the order or payment, the employee can contact the cafeteria staff directly for assistance. The staff will resolve the issue, update the system if necessary, and ensure a satisfactory resolution for the employee.
Exceptional Flow:

If there are unexpected changes to the menu, such as unavailability of certain items, the system notifies the employee and suggests alternative options based on their preferences or dietary restrictions.
Post-Conditions:

The employee successfully places an order for a meal through the Cafeteria Management System.
The cafeteria staff receives the order details and prepares the meal accordingly.
The employee receives a confirmation of the order and makes the payment.
