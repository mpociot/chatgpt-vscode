Features and benefits include:

UI components: Grommet offers robust and bold component designs and is lightweight to keep your app size in check. You will get multiple categories of components, such as layouts (footers, headers, cards, sidebars, grids, etc.), type (headings, text, paragraph, and markdown), color (branding, status, neutral colors, and accents), controls (buttons, navigation bars, menus, etc.), inputs (text, file uploads, checkboxes, etc.), media (video, carousels, and images), utilities to enhance user experience (responsive elements, keyboard shortcuts, infinite scroll, etc.), visualizations (calendars, avatars, charts, etc.)

Theming: There are plenty of pre-packaged themes available on Grommet – Grommet theme designer and Grommet designer. The former is a demo admin panel that lets you develop customized Grommet themes by adjusting elements. The latter is a canvas to create and save your design experiences with the components.

User-friendly interface: It is an easy to access UI library with tools like keyboard navigation and screen reader tags. It also supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). It’s a great tool for beginners.
