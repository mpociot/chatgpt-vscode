Theming: Semantic UI has high-level themes along with a smart inheritance system to provide you with complete design flexibility. It offers 3000+ theming variables. So, just develop the UI once and use it as many times as you want.

UI components: You get 50+ UI components to develop your complete site using just a single UI stack.
