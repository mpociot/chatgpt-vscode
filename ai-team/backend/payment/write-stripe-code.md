===

To implement the detailed state diagram using TypeScript and Stripe as the payment provider, you would need to divide the code into separate logical files and reference each other correctly. Here's an example structure for the code files:

`paymentStateMachine.ts`: This file contains the state machine definition and transitions for the payment process.

```ts
import { Machine, assign } from 'xstate';

interface PaymentContext {
  // Define the context properties here
  paymentIntentId: string | null;
}

type PaymentEvent =
  | { type: 'PAYMENT_REQUESTED' }
  | { type: 'PAYMENT_FAILED' }
  | { type: 'PAYMENT_COMPLETED' };

const paymentStateMachine = Machine<PaymentContext, PaymentEvent>(
  {
    id: 'payment',
    initial: 'idle',
    context: {
      paymentIntentId: null,
    },
    states: {
      idle: {
        on: {
          PAYMENT_REQUESTED: 'processing',
        },
      },
      processing: {
        entry: assign({
          paymentIntentId: (context) => {
            // Call Stripe API to create a Payment Intent and return the ID
            const paymentIntentId = 'payment_intent_id'; // Replace with actual Payment Intent ID
            return paymentIntentId;
          },
        }),
        on: {
          PAYMENT_FAILED: 'failed',
          PAYMENT_COMPLETED: 'completed',
        },
      },
      failed: {},
      completed: {},
    },
  },
  {
    actions: {},
  }
);

export default paymentStateMachine;
```

`paymentService.ts`: This file contains the service that interacts with Stripe API for payment processing.

```ts
import Stripe from 'stripe';

class PaymentService {
  private stripe: Stripe;

  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.stripe = new Stripe(apiKey);
  }

  async createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string): Promise<string> {
    // Call Stripe API to create a Payment Intent and return the ID
    const paymentIntent = await this.stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount,
      currency,
    });
    return paymentIntent.id;
  }

  // Other methods for handling payment processing with Stripe
}

export default PaymentService;
```

`paymentController.ts`: This file contains the controller logic for handling payment requests and invoking the state machine.

```ts
import { interpret } from 'xstate';
import paymentStateMachine, { PaymentEvent } from './paymentStateMachine';

class PaymentController {
  private machineService = interpret(paymentStateMachine).start();

  requestPayment(): void {
    const event: PaymentEvent = { type: 'PAYMENT_REQUESTED' };
    this.machineService.send(event);
  }

  // Other methods for handling payment events and transitions
}

export default PaymentController;
```

`main.ts`: This is the entry point file where you can initialize the payment controller and handle payment requests.

```ts
import PaymentController from './paymentController';

const paymentController = new PaymentController();
paymentController.requestPayment();
```

// Other code for handling application logic
Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements and integration with Stripe. Additionally, you would need to install the necessary packages (xstate, stripe, etc.) using a package manager like npm or yarn.

Make sure to replace the placeholder values and add the necessary error handling, async/await, and API integration logic as per your application's requirements.

Remember to set up the Stripe API keys and configure your environment accordingly to ensure proper integration with Stripe's services.
