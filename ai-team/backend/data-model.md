    Employee ||--o{ Payment : Makes
    Employee ||--o{ CafeteriaStaff : Manages

    Order ||--|{ Payment : Includes

    Menu ||--o{ OrderItem : Has

    Employee {
        string employeeId
        string firstName
        string lastName
        string username
        string password
        string email
        string employeeMealCard
    }

    Order {
        string orderId
        string employeeId
    }

    Payment {
        string paymentId
        string employeeId
        string orderId
        number amount
        string paymentMethod
    }

    Menu {
        string menuId
        string name
        string description
