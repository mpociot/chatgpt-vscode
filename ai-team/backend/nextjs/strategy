First set up the project and identify the main libraries and tools to use.

Ask the user for:
- Which nextjs project generator to use
- Which Cloud hosting provider to use
- Which external APIs to use
- Which Database to use
- Which Payment provider to use
- Which Authentication provider to use

Leverage Blitz to the extent possible to simplify the project setup

Please suggest a good choice for each based on information provided by the user.

List the choices in the following manner:

Backend project generator:
Name:
Command to execute generator with name of project: `insert command here`

Nextjs supporting library:
Name:
Command to install backend library: `insert command here`

If you believe multiple supporting libraries should be used, list all such libraries and a single install command which installs them all.

Make sure the install commands also adds each library to the package.json file.
