Please create a User profile management page in NextJS which calls the tRPC API using best practices. What library or built-in functionality would you recommend to take the form data from the page and make the call to the API?
===

To handle form data and make API calls in a Next.js application, I recommend using the `react-hook-form` library. It's a lightweight form validation library that integrates well with Next.js and provides an easy way to manage form state and perform form submissions.

Here's an example of creating a User profile management page in Next.js that utilizes `react-hook-form` and makes API calls to the tRPC API:

Install `react-hook-form` and other necessary dependencies:

```
npm install react-hook-form trpc react-query
```

Create a new file for the User profile management page:

```jsx
Copy code
// pages/profile.js

import { useState } from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from 'react-query';
import { API } from '../path/to/api'; // Import your tRPC API

const ProfilePage = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const updateUserMutation = useMutation((data) => API.mutationName(data), {
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('getUser'); // Invalidate cached user data
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    updateUserMutation.mutate(data);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <div>
          <label>Name</label>
          <input {...register('name', { required: true })} />
          {errors.name && <span>Name is required</span>}
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>Email</label>
          <input {...register('email', { required: true, pattern: /^\S+@\S+$/i })} />
          {errors.email && <span>Valid email is required</span>}
        </div>
        {/* Add more form fields as needed */}
        <button type="submit" disabled={updateUserMutation.isLoading}>
          {updateUserMutation.isLoading ? 'Saving...' : 'Save'}
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProfilePage;
```

In this example, we're using the useForm hook from `react-hook-form` to handle form state and validation. The form fields are registered with the register function, and we can specify validation rules such as required and pattern directly in the register function.

The `useMutation` hook from `react-query` is used to handle the API call for updating the user profile. We define the onSuccess callback to invalidate the cached user data in the queryClient after a successful update.

Inside the `onSubmit` function, we call the mutate function from updateUserMutation to trigger the API call with the form data.

Note that you'll need to replace API.mutationName with the actual mutation name from your tRPC API.

Make sure to import and configure the necessary dependencies (react-hook-form, react-query, and trpc) in your Next.js application.

This example demonstrates a basic setup for form handling and API calls in Next.js using `react-hook-form` and `react-query`. You can expand upon this code to include additional form fields and validations as needed for your User profile management page.
