Please provide some Accessibility and Usability Guidelines for the use case. 
Suggest a few libraries that can be used effectively to ensure accessibility. 
Provide a few reusable components that incorporates good accessibility practices and can be used across the app. 
===

Accessibility and Usability Guidelines:

Provide proper semantic structure: Use HTML5 elements appropriately to give meaning to the content and structure of the page. Use headings, lists, and semantic elements like <nav>, <main>, <article>, etc., to enhance the accessibility and usability of the app.

Use ARIA attributes: Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide additional information and context for screen readers. Use attributes like aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, etc., to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

Ensure keyboard accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and form inputs, can be accessed and operated using the keyboard alone. Use proper focus management and keyboard navigation to make sure all users can interact with the app without relying on mouse or touch.

Provide clear and meaningful labels: Use descriptive labels for form inputs, buttons, and other interactive elements. Labels should be associated with their respective elements using the for attribute or proper nesting.

Use high contrast colors: Ensure that the color contrast between text and background meets the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. Use color combinations that are easily readable for users with low vision or color blindness.

Provide alternative text for images: Use the alt attribute to provide alternative text for images. This helps visually impaired users understand the content of the image even if they cannot see it.

Test with screen readers and assistive technologies: Conduct thorough testing using screen readers and assistive technologies to ensure that all content and functionality are accessible and usable. Pay attention to focus management, screen reader announcements, and overall user experience.

Suggested libraries for accessibility:

react-a11y: Provides accessibility linting rules and automated tests for React components.
react-axe: Integrates the aXe accessibility testing engine into React development workflow.
react-modal: Offers accessible and customizable modal dialogs for displaying content and interactions.
Reusable components with good accessibility practices:

Accessible Button:

Handles keyboard interactions and focus management.
Includes proper ARIA attributes and keyboard event handlers.
Accessible Form Inputs:

Provides proper labels associated with inputs.
Implements keyboard accessibility and validation.
Accessible Dropdown Menu:

Supports keyboard navigation and selection.
Includes ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
Accessible Tabs:

Allows keyboard navigation between tabs.
Updates ARIA attributes to indicate the active tab.
These components can be implemented using React and enhanced with the suggested accessibility libraries to ensure a more inclusive user experience.

Please choose 1-2 accessibility libraries. Then provide code for some functional components that use these libraries to ensure accessibility standards and guidelines are met.

Suggested accessibility libraries:

react-a11y: Provides accessibility linting rules and automated tests for React components.
react-axe: Integrates the aXe accessibility testing engine into React development workflow.
Here's an example of functional components that utilize these libraries to ensure accessibility standards:

AccessibleButton.js

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { analyze } from 'react-axe'; // Assuming react-axe library is installed

const AccessibleButton = ({ label, onClick }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // Perform button click action
    onClick();
  };

  // Analyze accessibility issues using react-axe
  React.useEffect(() => {
    analyze();
  }, []);

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick} aria-label={label}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};

AccessibleButton.propTypes = {
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default AccessibleButton;
```

AccessibleFormInput.js

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { reactA11y } from 'react-a11y'; // Assuming react-a11y library is installed

const AccessibleFormInput = ({ label, value, onChange }) => {
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const { value } = event.target;
    // Update input value
    onChange(value);
  };

  // Enable accessibility linting using react-a11y
  reactA11y(React);

  return (
    <div>
      <label>{label}</label>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
    </div>
  );
};

AccessibleFormInput.propTypes = {
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  value: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default AccessibleFormInput;
```

These components utilize the suggested accessibility libraries to enhance the accessibility of the buttons and form inputs. They perform accessibility checks and ensure proper ARIA attributes and keyboard interactions.
