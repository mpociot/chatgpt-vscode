Here are a few libraries that can be used to display, filter, and sort business data in a React app:

React Table: A flexible and customizable library for displaying tabular data.
Material-UI Data Grid: A powerful and feature-rich data grid component with built-in sorting, filtering, and pagination.
Ag-Grid: A highly performant and feature-packed data grid library with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.
React Query: A data-fetching library that provides hooks for fetching and managing data, which can be used in conjunction with other UI libraries for displaying and manipulating data.
Among these options, I would suggest using Material-UI Data Grid, as it provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying, filtering, and sorting data, and it integrates well with the Material-UI design system.

To install Material-UI Data Grid, you can use the following command:

```
npm install @mui/x-data-grid
```

Make sure to have the appropriate version of Material-UI installed as a peer dependency for compatibility.

Once installed, you can import and use the Data Grid component in your application to display and interact with business data.
