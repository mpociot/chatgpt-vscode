Please Create reusable layout components such as containers, grids, and columns for building consistent page structures for "GovWeb Solutions"
=== 


Certainly! Here's an example of reusable layout components using React and Tailwind CSS for building consistent page structures for "GovWeb Solutions":

```
// components/Container.jsx
import React from 'react';

const Container = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="container mx-auto">{children}</div>;
};

export default Container;

```

```
// components/Grid.jsx
import React from 'react';

const Grid = ({ children, cols }) => {
  return (
    <div className={`grid grid-cols-${cols} gap-4`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Grid;
```

```
// components/Column.jsx
import React from 'react';

const Column = ({ children, span }) => {
  return (
    <div className={`col-span-${span}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Column;

Now you can use these components to build consistent page structures throughout your "GovWeb Solutions" application. Here's an example of how you can use them:

```
import React from 'react';
import Container from './components/Container';
import Grid from './components/Grid';
import Column from './components/Column';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <Container>
      <h1>Welcome to GovWeb Solutions</h1>
      <Grid cols={2}>
        <Column span={1}>
          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Learn more about our company.</p>
        </Column>
        <Column span={1}>
          <h2>Services</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Design Consulting</li>
            <li>Digital Marketing</li>
          </ul>
        </Column>
      </Grid>
    </Container>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

In this example, the Container component represents a container element with a centered layout using the container class from Tailwind CSS. The Grid component creates a grid layout with the specified number of columns. The Column component represents a column within the grid with the specified span.

By using these reusable layout components, you can easily create consistent and flexible page structures for your "GovWeb Solutions" application. Feel free to customize the components and their styling based on your specific needs and design system.
