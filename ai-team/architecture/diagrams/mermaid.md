Generate code for mermaid sequence diagram for this use case 
===

Certainly! Here's an example of a Mermaid sequence diagram for the cafeteria management system use case:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant Employee
    participant Cafeteria
    participant PaymentGateway
    participant Kitchen

    Employee->Cafeteria: Place Order
    Cafeteria->Kitchen: Prepare Order
    Kitchen->Cafeteria: Order Ready
    Cafeteria->Employee: Serve Order
    Employee->Cafeteria: Make Payment
    Cafeteria->PaymentGateway: Process Payment
    PaymentGateway-->Cafeteria: Payment Success
    Cafeteria-->Employee: Payment Acknowledgement
```

This sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the employee, cafeteria, payment gateway, and kitchen components in the cafeteria management system. The sequence starts with the employee placing an order at the cafeteria. The kitchen prepares the order and notifies the cafeteria when it's ready. The cafeteria serves the order to the employee. Then, the employee makes a payment at the cafeteria, which is processed by the payment gateway. Finally, the cafeteria receives the payment confirmation and acknowledges it to the employee.

Create mermaid code for state transition diagram for payment of employees
===

Certainly! Here's an example of a Mermaid state transition diagram for the payment process of employees:


```
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Pending: Initialize Payment
    Pending --> Processing: Submit Payment
    Processing --> Completed: Payment Processed
    Completed --> [*]: Payment Received
```

In this state transition diagram, the payment process starts in the initial state [*] and transitions to the Pending state when the payment is initialized. From the Pending state, the payment transitions to the Processing state when it is submitted for processing. Once the payment is successfully processed, it transitions to the Completed state. Finally, from the Completed state, the payment transitions back to the initial state [*] when the payment is received.

Create more detailed state diagram
===

Certainly! Here's an example of a more detailed Mermaid state transition diagram for the payment process of employees:


```
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Init: Initialize Payment
    Init --> Verify: Verify Payment Details
    Verify --> Process: Process Payment
    Process --> Deduct: Deduct Amount from Account
    Deduct --> Transfer: Transfer Funds to Employee
    Transfer --> Notify: Notify Employee of Payment
    Notify --> [*]: Payment Complete

    Verify --> Cancel: Cancel Payment
    Process --> Cancel: Cancel Payment
    Deduct --> Cancel: Cancel Payment
    Transfer --> Cancel: Cancel Payment
    Notify --> Cancel: Cancel Payment
    Cancel --> [*]: Payment Canceled
```

In this state transition diagram, the payment process starts in the initial state [*] and transitions to the Init state when the payment is initialized. From the Init state, the payment moves to the Verify state to verify the payment details. If the payment details are valid, it transitions to the Process state to initiate the payment process. The payment then moves to the Deduct state to deduct the payment amount from the employee's account. Once the deduction is successful, it transitions to the Transfer state to transfer the funds to the employee's account. After the transfer, it moves to the Notify state to notify the employee of the payment. Finally, from the Notify state, the payment transitions back to the initial state [*] indicating the completion of the payment process.

Additionally, there is a possibility to cancel the payment at various stages. If the payment needs to be canceled during the verification, processing, deduction, transfer, or notification stages, it transitions to the Cancel state, and from there, it moves back to the initial state [*] indicating the cancellation of the payment.

Create state diagram for entire use case
===

Certainly! Here's a state diagram for the entire cafeteria management system use case:

```
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Startup: System Startup
    Startup --> Idle: System Ready

    Idle --> Menu: Select Menu Option
    Menu --> Order: Place Order
    Order --> Process: Process Order
    Process --> Prepare: Prepare Order
    Prepare --> Serve: Serve Order
    Serve --> Complete: Order Complete
    Complete --> Idle: Return to Idle

    Menu --> AddBalance: Add Balance
    AddBalance --> Idle: Return to Idle

    Menu --> CheckBalance: Check Balance
    CheckBalance --> Idle: Return to Idle

    Menu --> ViewHistory: View Order History
    ViewHistory --> Idle: Return to Idle

    Menu --> Quit: Quit System
    Quit --> Shutdown: System Shutdown
```

In this state diagram, the system starts in the initial state [*] and transitions to the Startup state when the system is being started up. From the Startup state, it moves to the Idle state, indicating that the system is ready and waiting for user input.

Once in the Idle state, users can select various options from the menu, such as placing an order (Menu --> Order), adding balance to their account (Menu --> AddBalance), checking their balance (Menu --> CheckBalance), viewing their order history (Menu --> ViewHistory), or quitting the system (Menu --> Quit).

If a user chooses to place an order, the system transitions to the Order state. The order is then processed (Order --> Process), prepared (Process --> Prepare), served (Prepare --> Serve), and marked as complete (Serve --> Complete). After the order is complete, the system returns to the Idle state.

Users can also add balance to their account, check their balance, or view their order history. Each of these options transitions to a corresponding state and then returns to the Idle state after the operation is complete.

If the user chooses to quit the system, the system transitions to the Quit state and eventually shuts down (Quit --> Shutdown).

                DisplayCart --> ConfirmOrder: Proceed to Checkout
            }

            state ConfirmOrder {
                [*] --> ProcessOrder: Process Order
                ProcessOrder --> DisplaySuccess: Display Success Message
                DisplaySuccess --> Menu: Return to Menu
            }
        }

        state Checkout {
            [*] --> ProcessPayment: Process Payment
            ProcessPayment --> DisplaySuccess: Display Success Message
            DisplaySuccess --> Menu: Return to Menu
        }

        state CancelOrder {
            [*] --> ConfirmCancellation: Confirm Cancellation
            ConfirmCancellation --> ProcessCancellation: Process Cancellation

        }

        Logout --> Startup: Logout and Restart
    }

    Startup --> Shutdown: System Shutdown
```

In this more detailed state diagram, the system starts in the initial state [*] and transitions to the Startup state during system startup. From the Startup state, it moves to the Idle state, indicating that the system is ready and waiting for user input.

Within the Idle state, users have various menu options such as viewing their balance, adding balance, viewing order history, placing an order, checking out, canceling an order, and logging out.

The Idle state contains substates for each menu option, allowing for more specific interactions. For example, users can view their balance (Menu --> ViewBalance), add balance to their account (Menu --> AddBalance), view their order history (Menu --> ViewOrderHistory), place an order (Menu --> PlaceOrder), proceed to checkout (Menu --> Checkout), cancel an order (Menu --> CancelOrder), or log out of the system (Menu --> Logout).

Some substates have further substates. For instance, within the PlaceOrder state, users can select items, add them to the cart, adjust quantities, view the cart, and confirm the order.

The diagram also includes transitions to handle specific actions, such as processing payments, displaying success messages, and returning to the main menu.

If the user chooses to log out, the system transitions back to the Startup state, allowing for a fresh start. Finally, the system can be shut down from the Startup state (Startup --> Shutdown).

This more detailed state diagram provides a comprehensive representation of the various states, substates, and transitions involved in the cafeteria management system. It showcases the different paths and interactions users can have with the system based on their menu selections.
