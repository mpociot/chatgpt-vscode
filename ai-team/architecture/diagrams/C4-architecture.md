Write a Structurizr DSL diagram for the system
===

Certainly! Here's the Structurizr DSL code for the Cafeteria Management System:

```
workspace {
  model {
    user = person "Employee"
    staff = person "Cafeteria Staff"
    system = softwareSystem "Cafeteria Management System" {
      containers {
        webApp = container "Web Application" {
          uses database, "Reads/Writes data to"
          uses paymentGateway, "Processes Payments via"
          uses orderService, "Places Orders via"
          uses menuService, "Fetches Menus from"
        }

        database = container "Database" {
          technology = "Relational Database"
        }

        paymentGateway = container "Payment Gateway" {
          technology = "External Service"
        }

        orderService = container "Order Service" {
          technology = "Microservice"
          uses database, "Stores Orders in"
        }

        menuService = container "Menu Service" {
          technology = "Microservice"
          uses database, "Stores Menus in"
        }
      }

      views {
        systemContext webApp {
          include *
          autoLayout
        }

        containerDiagram webApp {
          include *
          autoLayout
        }
      }
    }
  }

  views {
    configuration {
      theme "Cafeteria Management System" {
        font "Roboto", "14", "#ffffff"
        background "#363636"
        border "#d3d3d3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This Structurizr DSL code represents the high-level architecture of the Cafeteria Management System, including the web application, database, payment gateway, order service, and menu service. The relationships and dependencies between the components are defined using the appropriate DSL syntax.

Install structurizr CLI
===

See [structurizr container](https://github.com/structurizr/cli/blob/master/docs/containers.md)

A prebuilt Docker image is available at Docker Hub. To use it, for example:

```bash
docker pull structurizr/cli:latest
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/cli <parameters>
```

The file extension for a Structurizr file is typically `.dsl`. It is a common convention to use the ".dsl" extension to indicate that the file contains Structurizr DSL code. However, it's important to note that the file extension is not strictly enforced by the Structurizr platform, and you can choose any file extension you prefer as long as the content follows the Structurizr DSL syntax.

[Getting started with Structurizr lite](https://dev.to/simonbrown/getting-started-with-structurizr-lite-27d0)

Step 1) Create a directory somewhere to store our workspace.

Step 2)

Be sure to replace PATH with the full path to the directory created in step 1.

```bash
docker pull structurizr/lite
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v PATH:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```

For example, if the directory is located at `/Users/alice/structurizr`, the commands would be:

```bash
docker pull structurizr/lite
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 -v /Users/alice/structurizr:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/lite
```

Open the workspace in a web browser by heading to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see your diagram.
